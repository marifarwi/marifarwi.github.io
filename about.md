Mary Farwy, commonly known as 'Mari Farwi', is a spatial designer, architectural researcher, sometimes writer, and video maker who struggled with writing her own biography while referring to a third person. Mary comes from an architectural background, though her practice fluidly shifts between spatial design and biology. She received her architectural education at the faculty of Architecture in Politecnico Di Torino, which eradicated her relaxedness. So she made a carriere shift and graduated in 2020 from the Interior Architecture Master course at KABK, The Hague, where her interest in intersecting biology with spatial understandings grew. 

While maneuvering her way in the field, she worked on the ‘Care Water Closet’ project (2020), obtaining the Royal Interior Architecture master award from KABK. Later she worked on the ‘Making Dying Illegal’ research project (2021), powered by the StimuleringsFonds. 

Her work is driven by dismantling normative approaches to architecture, stretching to the architecture of genes, architecting perceptions and bodily experiences. She exhibited and worked in different environments in the Netherlands such as: Dutch Design Week, Fiber Festival, Stedelijk museum, Salwa Foundation, KABK and others. Currently she is part of the Biohacking Academy at WAAG Instituut in Amsterdam, stimulating her work as a ‘Hachitect’.
